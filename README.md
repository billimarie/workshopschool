### Required
#### 1. Go to FILE > NEW FILE
#### 2. Create a new file: `about.html`
#### 3. Type out the HTML structure. Use `index.html` as a guide. (Reminder: don't forget the `<head>` and `<body>` tags)
#### 4. Link your stylesheet (`styles.css`) in your `<head>`. Use `index.html` as a guide.

### Optional: Create a navigation system
#### 1. Read about website navigation systems. There are three different ways to create a navigation:
- BEST: Using an unordered list in a `<nav>`: [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav)
- Using an unordered list without a `<nav>`: [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_navbar.asp)
- Using a `<nav>` with anchors: [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/tag_nav.asp)
#### 2. Create a `<header>` at the top of your page. Make sure you type it after the open `<body>` tag.
#### 3. Inside your `<header>`, create your navigation system by following one of the tutorials in Step 1.
#### 4. Make sure your navigation system includes these links:
- Home (`index.html`)
- About (`about.html`)
#### 5. Test your navigation to make sure the links work.
#### 6. Style your navigation bar:
  - Give your `<nav>` a background color
  - Give your links (`<a>`) a color
  - Give your links a hover color (`a:hover`)
